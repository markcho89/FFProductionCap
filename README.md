# FFProductionCap
Farthest Frontier Production Cap Mod

You can set the production cap of buildings. If the unused amount of an item is over the limit, all buildings producing the item will be disabled (freeing up the workers,too).
If the item is used up and unused amount is below the limit, the buildings will be enabled again preserving the worker count.

To set the production cap, modify the ProductionCap.xml file. If you do not want the cap, simply remove the xml node or set it to large number (2147483647 is max).
The production cap is loaded on game launch and it cannot be changed mid-game (changes coming).

Upcoming changes:

<ul>
  <li>Production Cap for buildings that produce multiple items such as Fletchery, Blacksmith and so on.</li>
  <li>Add slider on resource UI to set the production cap in game, other than on game launch
</ul>
